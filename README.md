# DetectorSpam-Ham
This project implements a spam detection system using Flask. It analyzes long text inputs and classifies them as either 'SPAM' or 'HAM'(legitimate message)by identifying suspicious keywords and patterns commonly associated with malicious or unwanted content. Detected messages are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database for logging.
